# Module 3 Project - Tanzanian Water Wells


## Introduction

According to Tanzania’s Ministry of Water, more than 74,000 such pumps can be found throughout the country. While the installation of these pumps is largely funded via contributions from charitable and other non-governmental organizations (NGO’s), their ongoing maintenance is typically the responsibility of the local community within which they reside. Unfortunately, the cost of maintaining the pumps is often beyond the means of the local community, resulting in pumps becoming non-functional. Furthermore, local communities are often unaware of the need to perform the required maintenance due to the apparent lack of any significant problems with a pump up until the point it ultimately fails.

Through this analysis we are going to answer some of the questions as below:

Q1. Does source of water have an effect on the functionality of the wells?

Q2. Does Age of the wells effect the condition of the wells?

Q3. What is the best mode of payment for maintainence of wells?

Q4. Does having Public Meetings help to keep the wells functional?
